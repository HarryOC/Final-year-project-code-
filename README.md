## Craig's Zeta analysis

I also used the R-package Stylo, see:

`Eder M, Rybicki J, Kestemont M (2016). “Stylometry with R: a package for computational text analysis.” R Journal, 8(1), 107–121. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/index.html.`

Stylo was used to complete a Craig Zeta Analysis, using the package's `oppose()` function.
